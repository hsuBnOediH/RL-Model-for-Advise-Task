Fit
1. inite Q table
A Q-table is set up with columns representing actions (left, right, advise) and rows
2. state = start, action = [left,right, advise]
3. time the inv temp
4. softmax to get prob of all three action [1/3, 1/3,1/3] 
5. record the res, vs actual subject(left)--> win(+40)
40-0

6. compute the eroor between actual reward and  expected reward
7. use error to update Q value

after all the trails during fitting
simulation --> F
sum(log(prob)) 
SPM based on F to adjust(decent) on the pramas



[left,right, advise]
    [1,0,0]
                    [+40, nan, nan]

TDRL: 

set of params
    run trails one time

    q-> sample-> action VS subject actual action
    
    acc and complex eval by SPM as F
    acc: min diff between [1/3, 1/3,1/3] --> [1,0,0]
